# Welcome to .NET

## What is .NET?
- .NET is an open source developer platform created by Microsoft. It's for building many different types of apps, such as web apps, desktop apps, games, api, smart phones apps....
- In short, .NET Platform is a collection of **languages**, **libraries**, and **frameworks** to make various applications, developed under one common standard.
- With .Net platform you can build your app, test app, deploy the app and maintain. This is why .Net caters mostly all phases of SDLC.

## Supported Programming Languages
- Dozens of programming languages are supported by .Net provided they are compatible with the platform. [List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages)
- 3 different languages which are by default supported by .Net are
- C#: Object oriented, type safe language
    - object oriented means, that everything is an object. These objects are further organized with classes
    - Type-safe means that once you declare a type of a variable, you can't really change it. 
- Visual Basic : Supports UI and component oriented language.
- F#: F# is a functional programming language supported by .NET
- All .Net compliant languages ahve to follow a Standard. These standard are defined by CLS (Common Language Specification).
  - CLS gives a set of rules and regulation a .Net compliant language should follow. Ex all .Net compliant languages should be OOP languages, Array index should start from 0 etc...

## Technologies we'll be using during this training
- .NET 5 and C#
- SQL (Sql Server)
- ASP.NET Core for creating web applications
- Azure Cloud Service for hosting
- Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, jQuery and Angular for frontend

## [History of .Net](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/versioning-sdk-msbuild-vs)
- Microsoft introduced .Net 1.0 (deprecated) in 2002. It was known as .Net Framework
  
## .NET Implementation
4 main implementation of .NET 
- **.NET Framework**: first implementation of .NET, only works on windows, and it is shipped with every windows.
- **.NET / .NET Core**: .NET Core is the cross-platform implemtation of .NET, and is a successor of .NET Framework. 
    - This is a primary implementation of .NET and is the focus of ongoing development effort. This what we'll be using.
    -.NET 5
- **Mono**
    - .NET runtime that power Xamarin application. 
    - useful when small footprint is needed
    - also powers games built with Unity
- **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)**
    - Used for building modern, touch-enabled Windows applications and software for the Internet of Things (IoT). 
    - It's designed to unify the different types of devices that you may want to target, including PCs, tablets, phones, and even the Xbox.

## Components of .NET Implementation
- One or more runtime: Example, .NET Framework CLR, .NET 5 CLR
     - [CLR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr) stands for *Common Language Runtime* and it's a runtime environment provided by .NET.
     - Compilers and tools expose the common language runtime's functionality and enable you to write code that benefits from this [managed execution environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-execution-process).
- A class library, for example, .NET Framework Base Class Library, or .NET 5 Base Class Library.
- Optionally, we have one or more application frameworks, such as ASP.NET Core for web application development, Windows Forms, etc.
- Optionally, development tools. Some are shared among multiple implementations.

#### CLR? SDK?
- CLR Stands for Common Language Runtime, and it's runtime environment. It is also know as main execution Engine and is used to run any .Net application.
- SDK stands for Software Development Kit.
- CLR comes included in SDK

## .NET Standard
- .NET Standard is a base set of API's that are common to all .NET implementation.

### Additional Frameworks
These are frameworks that extend .NET platform to provide additional functionalities.
- **ASP.NET Core**: Open source framework for building web apps and web services
    - it's a redesign on ASP.NET 4.x with architectural changes that result in a lener, more modular framework
- **Unity**: Real-time 3D development platform
- **UWP (Universal Windows Platform)**: for developing various windows applications
- **Xamarin**: for mobile development
- **ML.NET**: machine learning
- and more..
## Types of Applications
- CUI (Character User Interface) - command line interface. Ex console app in .Net
- GUI (with user friendly UI) - Desktop app, web apps
- Smart UIs - Android or IOS
- APIs - REST Api
- Cloud application : Azure, GCP, AWS
### Other Niceties..
- **Nuget**: a package manager for .NET

.NET 5
ASP.NET: ASP.NET Core to match with .NET Core 

## C#
### [Anatomy of C# program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/)
- namespace -> Types -> Type members
    - Namespace
        - Types - Members (Methods, variables, properties)
- [Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/types) (Classes, Enums, Structs, Interface, Delegates)
  - All types in C# are inherited directly or indirectly Sytem.Object
        - **[Value Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-types)** - which has the direct value, stored in memory Stack, fast to access. Structs, Enums. Predefined (int, long, short, byte, DateTime, char)
        - **[Reference Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/reference-types)** - it stores the reference to that value, value is stored in heap, expensive retrieval process. Classes, interface, Delegates. Predefined -> string, arrays, collections etc
  - Type Conversion : conversion of 1 type into another 
    - Implicit type conversion : no need to type cast. Ex byte value can be placed in int. No data loss.
    - Explicit type conversion : type cast it using `<datatype>.Parse(value)`, `Convert.<datatype>(value)`. You can have a data loss if its not fitting in the type.
  
- **Boxing**- refers to conversion Value type to reference types.
- **Unboxing**- refers to conversion of reference types to value types.

## [Statments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/statements)
- A statement can consist of a single line of code that ends in a semicolon, or a series of single-line statements in a block. A statement block is enclosed in {} brackets and can contain nested blocks.
  -  **Expressions statements**: consists of operands and operators. Ex a + b ;
  -  **Declaration statements** : creating a new variable. Ex int a;
  -  **Selection Statements** : enables to branch a code in different sections based on the conditions. Ex if, else, switch, case.
  -  **Iteration Statements** : enables to repeat or loop through. Ex do-while, for, foreach, while.
  -  **Jump statements** : transfer controlt o another section of code. Ex break, continue, default, goto, return.
  -  **Exception handling statements** : recover from runtime errors gracefully. Ex throw, try-catch, try-catch-finally, try-finally.

## [Arrays](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/arrays/) 
- A variable to hold multiple values which are of same type (homogenous) and are located in contigious memory location.
- An array which in initialized must consist of a value.
