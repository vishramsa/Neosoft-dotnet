## [Collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/collections/)
- Similar data can often be handled more efficiently when stored and manipulated as a collection. 
- You can use arrays, non-generic or generics.
- Arrays have fixed size and every element must have a value if no value is provided it contains the default.
- Arrays cannot be grown or shrinked. This where collection solves the problem.
- C# offers 2 categories of Collections:
    - non-generics
    - generics
- **Non-generic** collections store items as Object, require casting. Performance concerns were arised due to this casting and also Garbage Collection.
- **Generic collections** are type-safe at compile time. Because of this, generic collections typically offer better performance. 
- Generic collections accept a type parameter when they are constructed and do not require that you cast to and from.
- All collections provide methods for adding, removing, or finding items in the collection.
- All collections can be **enumerated** by virtue of **Enumerator**.
- An enumerator can be thought of as a movable pointer to any element in the collection.
- Types of Collections:
    - Stack - LIFO (Push, Pop, Peek)
    - Queue - FIFO (Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek)
    - List - Like any array which can grow and shrink dynamically.
    - Dictionary<Tkey,TValue> - Key Value Pair
    - LinkedList - Each element points to next.
- You can query your collections using [LINQ](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/linq/linq-tutorials). You can query using query Syntax or Method Syntax.
## [Memory Management in .Net](https://medium.com/c-programming/c-memory-management-part-1-c03741c24e4b)
- The GC allocates heap segments where each segment is a contiguous range of memory.
- Objects are allocated in contiguous blocks of memory.
- To mitigate fragmentation, when the [Garbage COllector](https://medium.com/c-programming/c-memory-management-part-3-garbage-collection-18faf118cbf1) frees memory, it tries to defragment it. This process is called **compaction**.
- Objects placed in the heap are categorized into one of 3 generations: 0, 1, or 2. 
- The generation determines the frequency the GC attempts to release memory on managed objects that are no longer referenced by the app. 
- Lower numbered generations are GC'd more frequently.
- Objects are moved from one generation to another based on their lifetime. 
- As objects live longer, they are moved into a higher generation. 
- As mentioned previously, higher generations are GC'd less often. 
- Short term lived objects always remain in generation 0. 
- For example, objects that are referenced during the life of a web request are short lived. 
- Application level singletons generally migrate to generation 2.

- **What is a finalizer?**
    - Finalizers (which are also called destructors) are used to perform any necessary final clean-up when a class instance is being collected by the garbage collector. Some important points about finalizers are:
    - A class can have only one finalizer.
    - A finalizer does not have modifiers or parameters.
    - Finalizers cannot be called explicitly, they are called by the garbage collector (GC) when the GC considers the object eligible for finalization. 
    - They are also called when the program finishes in .NET framework applications.
```
    class Person
    {
        //properties
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }

        public Person() //constructor
        {
            //initialization statements
        }

        ~Person() //finalizer (destructor)
        {
            //cleanup statements
        }
    }
```
- Finalizers called inhertiance chain: finalizers are called recursively for all instances in the inheritance chain, from the most-derived to the least-derived.

```
    class Person
    {
        ~Person() //finalizer (destructor)
        {
            //cleanup statements
            Console.WriteLine("Person's finalizer is called.");
        }
    }

    class Employee : Person
    {
        ~Employee()
        {
            //cleanup statements
            Console.WriteLine("Employee's finalizer is called.");
        }
    }

    class Manager : Employee
    {
        ~Manager()
        {
            //cleanup statements
            Console.WriteLine("Manager's finalizer is called.");
        }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var manager = new Manager();
        }
    }
```

- **Native memory**
    - Some .NET Core objects rely on native memory. 
    - Native memory can not be collected by the GC. 
    - The .NET object using native memory must free it using native code.
    - .NET provides the IDisposable interface to let developers release native memory. 
    - Even if Dispose is not called, correctly implemented classes call Dispose when the finalizer runs.

- **What is Dispose Method?**
    - We mentioned above that finalizers are called by the garbage collector or when the program finishes (in .NET framework applications). 
    - This means we cannot call them. 
    - If our application uses an expensive external resource, we should then release the resource explicitly. 
    - We can do this by implementing Dispose method from IDisposable interface. 
    - By this way, we can improve the performance of our application as well. Now, let’s see this in practice.

- **How to Implement Dispose Method?**
    - First, we create a class that implements IDisposable interface and then choose Implement interface with Dispose pattern.
```
   class DatabaseConnection : IDisposable
    {

        #region IDisposable Support
        private bool disposedValue = false; // To detect redundant calls

        protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            if (!disposedValue)
            {
                if (disposing)
                {
                    // TODO: dispose managed state (managed objects).
                }

                // TODO: free unmanaged resources (unmanaged objects) and override a finalizer below.
                // TODO: set large fields to null.

                disposedValue = true;
            }
        }

        // TODO: override a finalizer only if Dispose(bool disposing) above has code to free unmanaged resources.
        // ~DatabaseConnection() {
        //   // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
        //   Dispose(false);
        // }

        // This code added to correctly implement the disposable pattern.
        public void Dispose()
        {
            // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
            Dispose(true);
            // TODO: uncomment the following line if the finalizer is overridden above.
            // GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
        }
        #endregion

    }
```
- Ex:
```
    class DatabaseConnection : IDisposable
    {

        #region IDisposable Support
        private bool disposedValue = false; // To detect redundant calls

        protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            if (!disposedValue)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("This is the first call to Dispose. Necessary clean-up will be done!");

                if (disposing)
                {
                    // TODO: dispose managed state (managed objects).
                    Console.WriteLine("Explicit call: Dispose is called by the user.");
                }
                else
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Implicit call: Dispose is called through finalization.");
                }

                // TODO: free unmanaged resources (unmanaged objects) and override a finalizer below.
                Console.WriteLine("Unmanaged resources are cleaned up here.");

                // TODO: set large fields to null.

                disposedValue = true;
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Dispose is called more than one time. No need to clean up!");
            }
        }

        // TODO: override a finalizer only if Dispose(bool disposing) above has code to free unmanaged resources.
        ~DatabaseConnection()
        {
            // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
            Dispose(false);
        }

        // This code added to correctly implement the disposable pattern.
        public void Dispose()
        {
           // Do not change this code. Put cleanup code in Dispose(bool disposing) above.
            Dispose(true);
            // TODO: uncomment the following line if the finalizer is overridden above.
            GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
        } 
        #endregion

    }
```

- Now, we can use DatabaseConnection class in order to see how Dispose pattern acts in different scenarios.
```
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var connection = new DatabaseConnection();
            try
            {
                //Write your operational code here
            }
            finally
            {
                connection.Dispose();
            }
        }
    }
```

- Another and commonly used method to call Dispose is using using statement:

```
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            using (var connection = new DatabaseConnection())
            {
                //Write your operational code here
            }
        }
    }
```
- As you see there is no call to Dispose method because the using statement handles that automatically.
- Both codes above generate the same output.
- in C# 8.0 and above version you can use [using statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement)
  
  ```
    class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                using var connection = new DatabaseConnection()            
                    //Write your operational code here            
            }
        }
  ```
## [File Handling In C#](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_file_io.htm)
- **System.IO** namespace provides four classes that allow you to manipulate individual files, as well as interact with a machine directory structure.
- The **Directory** and **File** directly extends System.Object and supports the creation, copying, moving and deletion of files using various static methods.
    -  They only contain static methods and are never instantiated.
- The **FileInfo** and **DirectoryInfo** types are derived from the abstract class **FileSystemInfo** type and they are typically, employed for obtaining the full details of a file or directory because their members tend to return strongly typed objects.
    - They implement roughly the same public methods as a Directory and a File but they are stateful and the members of these classes are not static.

## Serialization :
- Serialization is the process of converting an object into a form that can be readily transported. For example, you can serialize an object and transport it over the Internet using HTTP between a client and a server. 
- On the other end, deserialization reconstructs the object from the stream.
- The most common formats of serializations are:
    - [XML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/introducing-xml-serialization): XML serialization serializes only the public fields and property values of an object into an XML stream. 
        - You can use [XML Serializer]() class to serialize your objects.
        - The following items can be serialized using the XmlSerializer class:
            - Public read/write properties and fields of public classes.
            - Classes that implement ICollection or IEnumerable.
## Viewing contents of an assembly
- You can view the metadata about the assembly in 2 ways:
  - Runtime: which means all the contents will be loaded at runtime of the program. We use Reflections in C# to view contents at runtime.
  - Compile Time - ILDASM.exe is used to view contents with Gui. 
## [Exception and Exception Handling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/exceptions/)
- [Checked and Unchecked](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/checked-and-unchecked)
  - C# statements can execute in either checked or unchecked context. 
  - The [checked](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/checked) keyword is used to explicitly enable overflow checking for integral-type arithmetic operations and conversions.
  - In an [unchecked](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/unchecked) context, arithmetic overflow is ignored and the result is truncated by discarding any high-order bits that don't fit in the destination type.

## Testing 
- Black-box, white-box testing
- Performance Testing, Load Testing, Smoke testing, Integration Testing, Penetration Testing, Unit Testing.
- **Unit Testing** is important component of developer testing which is heavily used in TDD.
  - In.Net/.Net Core supports multiple frameworks for testing 
  - MSTest, NUnit, xUnit.
## [Delegates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/using-delegates): 
- Type Safe function pointers. Delegates are tied to method of same type, which means delegate's declaration should match with function declration. There are 2 types of delegates:
    1. Single cast delegate - which holds single method.
    2. Multi cast delegate - which holds more than one method.
- Delegates are the building blocks of event.
- Delegates are used to create anonymous methods and lambda expresssions
- There are a few predefined delegates in C#:
    - Action<>() -> this is a delegate of type void
    - Func<>(T, T) -> this delegate has a return type.
    - Predicate() -> returns bool
## [SOLID Principles](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/the-s-o-l-i-d-principles-in-pictures-b34ce2f1e898)
- SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin
- These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows.
- Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.
- Projects that adhere to SOLID principles can be shared with collaborators, extended, modified, tested, and refactored with fewer complications.
- SOLID stands for:
  - S - Single-responsiblity Principle
  - O - Open-closed Principle
  - L - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - I - Interface Segregation Principle
  - D - Dependency Inversion Principle
- Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states:
    - A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
    - If a Class has many responsibilities, it increases the possibility of bugs because making changes to one of its responsibilities, could affect the other ones without you knowing.
    - This principle aims to separate behaviours so that if bugs arise as a result of your change, it won’t affect other unrelated behaviours.
- Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:
  - Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - Changing the current behaviour of a Class will affect all the systems using that Class.
  - If you want the Class to perform more functions, the ideal approach is to add to the functions that already exist NOT change them.
  - This principle aims to extend a Class’s behaviour without changing the existing behaviour of that Class. This is to avoid causing bugs wherever the Class is being used.
- Liskov Substitution Principle states:
  - Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
  - If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.
  - This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
  - When a child Class cannot perform the same actions as its parent Class, this can cause bugs.
  - If you have a Class and create another Class from it, it becomes a parent and the new Class becomes a child. 
  - The child Class should be able to do everything the parent Class can do. This process is called Inheritance.
  - The child Class should be able to process the same requests and deliver the same result as the parent Class or it could deliver a result that is of the same type.
  - Ex - the parent Class delivers Coffee(it could be any type of coffee). It is acceptable for the child Class to deliver Cappucino because it is a specific type of Coffee, but it is NOT acceptable to deliver Water.If the child Class doesn’t meet these requirements, it means the child Class is changed completely and violates this principle.
  - This principle aims to enforce consistency so that the parent Class or its child Class can be used in the same way without any errors.
- Interface segregation principle states:
  - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
  - When a Class is required to perform actions that are not useful, it is wasteful and may produce unexpected bugs if the Class does not have the ability to perform those actions.
  - A Class should perform only actions that are needed to fulfil its role. Any other action should be removed completely or moved somewhere else if it might be used by another Class in the future.
  - This principle aims at splitting a set of actions into smaller sets so that a Class executes ONLY the set of actions it requires.
- Dependency inversion principle states:
  - Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, both  should depend on abstractions.
  - In other words, abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
  - This principle allows for decoupling.
  - High-level Module(or Class): Class that executes an action with a tool.
  - Low-level Module (or Class): The tool that is needed to execute the action
  - Abstraction: Represents an interface that connects the two Classes.
  - Details: How the tool works
  - This principle says a Class should not be fused with the tool it uses to execute an action. Rather, it should be fused to the interface that will allow the tool to connect to the Class.
  - It also says that both the Class and the interface should not know how the tool works. However, the tool needs to meet the specification of the interface.
  - This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level Class on the low-level Class by introducing an interface.
## [Design Patterns](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns)
- Design patterns are reusable solutions to the problems that we encounter in the day to day programming. They are generally targeted at solving the problems of object generation and integration. 
- In other words, Design patterns acts as templates which can be applied to the real-world programming problems.
- **History and evolution of design Patterns**
  - The four authors of the book famously know as Gang of four are the ones who brought the concepts of design patterns in their book “Elements of reusable Object-Oriented software” . 
  - Gang of Four has divided the book into two parts with first part explaining about the pros and cons of object oriented programming and the second part describes the evolution of 23 classic software design patterns.
- **Types of Design Patterns**
    - Gang of Four have categorised the design patterns in to 3 types based on different problems encountered in the real world applications. They are **Creational, Structural** and **Behavioural**. 
      - **Creational design patterns**: These patterns deal with object creation and initialization. Creational pattern gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
        - Examples of Creational design patterns category : Singleton , Factory and Abstract Factory etc.
      - **Structural design patterns** : This pattern deals with class and object composition. In simple words, This pattern focuses on decoupling interface, implementation of classes and its objects. 
        - Examples of Structural design patterns category : Adapter,  Facade and Bridge etc.
      - **Behavioural design patterns** : These patterns deal with communication between Classes and objects.
        - Examples of Behavioural design patterns : Chain of Responsibility, Command and Interpreter etc.
 ## [Singleton](https://csharpindepth.com/articles/singleton)
 - Singleton Pattern belongs to Creational type pattern which means creational pattern explain us the creation of objects in a manner suitable to a given situation.
 - Singleton design pattern is used when we need to ensure that only one object of a particular class is Instantiated. 
 - That single instance created is responsible to coordinate actions across the application.
 - Why Singleton: Concurrent access to the resource is well managed by singleton design pattern.
 - As part of the Implementation guidelines we need to ensure that only one instance of the class exists by declaring all constructors of the class to be private.  Also, to control the singleton access we need to provide a static property that returns a single instance of the object.

### Real world examples of Singleton : 
- Exception/Information logging
- Connection pool management 
- File management
- Device management such as printer spooling
- Application Configuration management
- Cache management
- And Session based shopping cart are some of the real world usage of singleton design pattern
### Static classes vs Singleton
- Static is a keyword and Singleton is a design pattern
- Static classes can contain only static members
- Singleton is an object creational pattern with one instance of the class
- Singleton can implement interfaces, inherit from other classes and it aligns with the OOPS concepts
- Singleton object can be passed as a reference
- Singleton supports object disposal
- Singleton object is stored on heap
- Singleton objects can be cloned
